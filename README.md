Step-by-Step Implementation:
User Authentication (OAuth2 or Firebase):
Use OAuth2 for secure user authentication, or you can use Firebase Authentication for easier integration with Google Cloud.
Microservices:
Wallet Service: Handles wallet balance, transactions, and transfer of funds.
Loan Management Service: Handles loan requests, calculates interest rates, and tracks repayments.
Notification Service: Sends real-time alerts via email or SMS when transactions are completed or loans are due.
Database:
Cloud SQL: For persistent storage of user data, transaction history, and loan details.
Redis: For caching real-time data like user balance or loan status.
Containerization & Orchestration:
Docker: Containerize each microservice (Wallet, Loan, Notifications).
Kubernetes: Deploy the containers to a Kubernetes cluster for scaling.
Cloud Integration:
Use Google Cloud Storage for storing documents like loan agreements.
Leverage Google Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging to track app performance.
